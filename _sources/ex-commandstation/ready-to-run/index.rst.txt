   EX-CSB1 CommandStation / Booster

The |EX-CSB1| addresses the needs of DCC-EX users who want a *ready-to-run* (RTR) DCC command station, which will have them running trains within 5 minutes of plugging it into power and track and connecting your WiFi smart phone.

This DCC-EX Command Station can now outperform commercial DCC command stations, which typically have single 3-3.5A or single 5A output capabilities, at a fraction of the cost, while providing more advanced features.

The |EX-CSB1| is the second offering in the DCC-EX open source hardware ecosystem specifically designed for model railroaders, and is a direct result of the strong community engagement |DCC-EX| strives to inspire.

Features
========

The |DCC-EX| |EX-CSB1| comes ready to use out of the box and has the following features:

*	**Dual DCC/PWM DC outputs** with up to 5A capacity – easily expandable to 4 outputs
*	**WiFi built-in** – fast 802.11n capable, with Access Point and Station modes including support for connecting as many as 10 WiFi throttles (you can also connect to JMRI via WiFi, but a USB cable is often better)
*	**Single power supply** for track and onboard electronics – 12-25V DC with polarity protection
*	**USB-C connector** – for software upload, diagnostic monitoring, DCC-EX WebThrottle and JMRI connectivity
*	**Railsync DCC input** – enables booster mode, which with an optional EX-RAIL script can be automatically engaged on receipt of a signal
