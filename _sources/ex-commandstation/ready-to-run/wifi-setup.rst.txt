The |EX-CSB1| comes with WiFi onboard.

.. sidebar:: Using JMRI (Alternate)
   
   |conductor| |BR| An *Alternate* to connecting to your |EX-CSB1| directly via WiFi is to do so indirectly through |JMRI|. To do this you use a USB cable instead. This is described on the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/advanced-setup/supported-connections/jmri` page.
   
The purpose of having WiFi on your |EX-CSB1| is allow connection up to 5 WiFi throttles (e.g. phones) DIRECTLY to it, eliminating the need for a computer and another software controller. 

However, use WiFi is optional. If you wish to simply use your computer connected via a USB cable to the |EX-CSB1| with the |JMRI| application (or similar), you can :doc:`skip ahead to the next page </ex-commandstation/installer-rtr>`.

If you wish to run trains from your phone, tablet or other |WiThrottle protocol| devices connected directly to the |EX-CSB1| over WiFi, without a PC involved, then you will only need to select how you are going to configure the WiFi during the software installation stage, by choosing either **Access Point** mode or **Station** mode.  

* **Access Point mode** |BR| You can configure the EX-CommandStation to have its own, completely isolated, WiFi Network. This is referred to as *Access Point Mode*. (Most useful if your layout is away from the house / home network, or you transport your layout frequently.) |BR| |BR|

* **Station mode**  |BR| The EX-CommandStation can be setup so that it connects to your existing home WiFi Network. This is referred to as *Station Mode*.

.. warning:: 

   |SUITABLE| |tinkerer| |engineer| |BR| Using WiFi (OR Ethernet) to talk between |JMRI| and |EX-CS| is complex, slow and functionally limited and, while it generally works, it is NOT SUPPORTED.
