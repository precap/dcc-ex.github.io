|EX-CSB1|

The |EX-CSB1| is the first fully integrated DCC Command Station with DC PWM and Booster mode capabilities developed by the DCC-EX Team. 

This versatile board can function as a complete Command Station with USB or WiFi connectivity or serve as a stand-alone booster, making it an ideal addition to any layout, including those using non-DCC-EX systems.

This page describes and explains the |EX-CSB1| in detail.

.. note:: If you are setting up your |EX-CSB1| for the first time we recommend that you look at the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/ready-to-run/connecting` page first.

   Barrel Jack

**Input Power Barrel Jack** - The CSB1 normally comes with a barrel jack for compatibility with most laptop-type power supplies that use a 2.1mm inner hole diameter and a 5.5mm outer shank diameter. 

Be careful since some power supplies have a 2.5mm inner hole which is likely to be too loose. The barrel jack input power is reverse voltage protected. This supplies a 5V switching regulator for all electronics on the board including a 3.3V regulator for 3.3V components, an optional |EX-MS| stacked on top, and power out to the track. 

While it is capable of 10v-25v operation, it is best to choose a suitable track voltage for your scale. Typically this is 12-15v for N scale, and 14-16v for HO scale. With help in choosing your power supply or using one with bare wires instead of a barrel connector, see `Powering the EX-CSB1`_ below.

   USB Connector

**USB-C Power/Data Connector** - The USB connector can provide power from a computer or any 500mA or larger USB or USB-C Power Delivery (USB-C PD) power supply.  In this way you can connect your EX-CSB1 to a computer and update your software version or load EXRAIL scripts that run your accessories. However, without a power supply powering the DC input jack, you cannot supply power to the rails to run trains. 

You can connect your track Power supply (see above) to the barrel jack while the USB is connected, as they will not interfere with each other. You may also wish to do this to isolate the EX-CSB1 processor power from any interruptions to track power due to overload for example. 

The USB port is also very useful for connecting a serial monitor to test the command station and view logging information in real time to aid in fault finding. See :doc:`/reference/tools/serial-monitor`

   :alt: Pluggable Track Output Connectors
   :scale: 40%
   :align: right

   Pluggable Track |BR| Output Connectors

**Track A and B Outputs** - These are female pluggable terminals that accept a removable male screw terminal plug (included with your CSB1). Using the removable connectors allows for easy reconfiguration, testing, and placement of your command station. You can unsolder these connectors (or ask for a special order) and replace them with 3.5mm pitch screw terminals if you prefer. 

For DCC operation, output A is usually the MAIN track and output B is the programming track. However, with our TrackManager :sup:`tm` feature, you can configure any output to be DCC, DC, MAIN, or PROG. You should keep the phase of the tracks aligned, so if a train crosses from one power district to another it doesn't intentionally cause a short (unless it's a reversing loop and you have assigned that output to have Auto-Reverse capability.) See: :doc:`/ex-installer/managing-config-files`. 

Power to each output can be controlled together or individually. Correct wired gauge for the screw terminals is 16 to 28AWG (1.5mm^2). Be sure your wire gauge can handle the current you expect on the track.

   Track Output LEDs

**Track Power LEDs** - These are indicators that power is being sent to the track, and the mode of the output. With DCC operation, both LEDs should shine brightly when your throttle issues the power-on command. 

You can also configure the CSB1 to start with power on using a mySetup.h or myAutomation.h file, or by selecting one of the options in |EX-I|. See the :ref:`EX -Installer page <ex-installer/installing:start with power on>` for more information on how to change this behaviour. 

For DC PWM mode operation, when power is on, ONE LED will light for each direction. That is, forward will light one LED and when you select reverse, the other LED will light.

**OLED I2C Header** - This header is primarily designed for an OLED display, but can also be used as a female header for any I2C device that has male pins or for use with Dupont jumper wires. 

*IMPORTANT:* Many .96" and 1.3" OLED displays, and some others will connect directly to the pins, however **beware** that sadly there is no standard for pin order. 

Make absolutely sure that any display you purchase to connect directly to the header has its pins in the correct order! The correct order is GND, V+, SCL, SDA and is different than other OLED connectors on the board. For more information see: :doc:`/reference/hardware/i2c-devices`.

**Dual I2C Header** - This is a dual male pin I2C header with 2 rows of I2C bus connectors one beside the other. They are wired together on the same I2C bus as the QWiic connector and OLED I2C Header. 

*IMPORTANT:* The pin order on these two rows are different from the OLED header, pay attention to the pin order when using Dupont female wires. The correct order for this header is SCL, GND, SDA and V+ as labelled on the board. 

The EX-CSB1 is a 3.3V device, so all the I2C connectors only supply 3.3V unlike the Arduino Mega. Keep that in mind if you are upgrading from a DIY Arduino Command Station to a 3.3V device like the EX-CSB1 and are connecting I2C devices.

**Reset Button** - Pressing the reset button does a hard reset of the command station. If the Command Station gets into an unexpected state, you can reset it by pressing this button. 

The DCC-EX software, |EX-R| Scripts, and any other settings are maintained, but the unit reboots as if it had been turned off. Boards stacked on top of the EX-CSB1 also receive the reset signal, but less well designed boards may not be reset depending upon their own circuit peculiarities. Only rarely should it require unplugging all power from the EX-CSB1 to perform a power-on hard reset.

**5V LED** - The 5V LED will light whenever power is supplied to the barrel jack. This LED indicates that power is being supplied to the 5V regulator which can power an EX-MotorShield 8874 stacked onto the GPIO Headers. 

Power from the barrel jack will power the 5V regulator which in turn powers the 3.3V regulator. Therefore, when power is supplied via the barrel jack, both the 5V and 3.3V LEDs will be lit.

|FORCE-BREAK|

**GPIO Headers** - The 4 GPIO headers accept a DCC-EX |EX-MS|. The EX-CSB1 itself has 2 outputs for 2 track power districts. 

Stacking the EX8874 on these headers provides 2 additional power districts for a total of 4. Any of the 4 outputs can be used for any combination of DCC MAIN, DCC PROG, or DC PWM. You must enable the extra board from the EX-Installer or your config.h file for a manual install.

Powering the EX-CSB1
=====================

   :scale: 40%
   :align: right
   :alt: 2.1mm screw terminal adapter

   2.1mm Screw Terminal Adapter

The |EX-CSB1| has a 2.1mm x 5.5mm power jack. If you already have a power supply with bare wires, you can use an optional 2.1mm x 5.5mm screw terminal block adapter. For more information about power supplies, including how to use one power supply to supply all the different voltages on your layout, see :ref:`Power Supplies <reference/hardware/power-supplies:power supplies>`.

To power up the CSB1, just plug your power supply into the mains power (aka wall outlet) and connect the barrel end to the Command Station. Make sure your power supply matches the needs of your setup: the voltage should be between 12V and 25V DC, depending on the scale of your locomotives, and it should provide at least 2A of current with good over-current performance and voltage stability.

To get the most out of your EX-CSB1, we suggest using a modern switching power supply with 4A or more. For Z scale, 12V is usually enough, but for N, HO, and OO scales, we recommend using between 14V and 16V DC. It's important that your DC power is well-regulated which is why we suggest a modern switch-mode power supply with double insulation and strong overload protection.

   12V/3A Power Supply

.. NOTE:: Your power supply can be rated at *or above* the specified Amperage rating. You must not exceed the voltage rating of your device, but a little extra current is ok, since the CSB1 will only use as much as it needs. However, remember that both voltage and current can be dangerous.

.. TODO XXX For more details on how much current do I need, see [link] XXX

When you connect power to the CSB1, you should see one or both bright green power LEDs light up, confirming that the electronics are working. 

However, for safety, track power will be off by default when you first plug in the EX-CSB1. This is to prevent power from accidentally being applied to your layout before everything is ready. See the :ref:`EX -Installer page <ex-installer/installing:start with power on>` for more information on how to change this behaviour.

Connecting and Testing Your Command Station
============================================

What you will need
--------------------

* **An EX-CSB1 Command Station**
* **A Power supply** (12V - 16V DC see :ref:`Power Supplies <reference/hardware/power-supplies:power supplies>`)
* **A DCC loco** (DC can work also)
* **Track**
* **A throttle** (You can use your phone or a computer - see below)
* 16 to 28AWG/1.5mm^2 **Wire**
* A Jeweller's flat bladed **screwdriver** (1.5 - 2mm blade)
* A laptop or other **computer** [PC]_
* A **USB cable** with one end a USB-C for the EX-CSB1, and the other to suit your PC*

.. [PC] Optional for connecting connecting to a computer for |EX-WT|, |JMRI| and to reload the |EX-CS| software.

Start with all power disconnected
----------------------------------

Before connecting any wires to your command station or tracks, make sure you have unplugged the power supply from the wall or removed the barrel connector from the command station. It is crucial to ensure that the command station has no power while you are working on your connections.

Connecting to Your Tracks
--------------------------

The power connection to your track will be either wires you solder yourself to the rails or via a power connector that plugs into track such as Kato Unitrack. We will leave it up to you to determine the proper connection to your track.

Once you are sure power is disconnected from the CS and the power LED is no longer illuminated, you can connect wires from the A output (+ and -) of the command station to the track. 

For DCC operation it does not matter which wire goes to which rail, since there is no polarity. However, as you layout grows, it is important to stay consistent with your wiring to ensure that different power districts remain in phase. That just means that when the tracks rapidly switch between one being energized and the other at ground potential, all the districts stay synchronised. 


.. todo XXX You can find more detail on this in our wiring section XXX. [link]

For DC operation, polarity does matter. One rail is positive, and the other is negative, which determines the direction your train will move when voltage is applied through the command station. If you reverse the voltage, the train will change direction and run in reverse.

DCC Operation - The Default
---------------------------

The EX-CSB1 is set to operate in DCC mode by default. 

Optional DC Operation
---------------------

Refer to :ref:`ex-commandstation/ready-to-run/manual:dc operation` section for information.

Track Outputs
--------------

You will notice that the two track outputs on the |EX-CSB1| are labelled A and B. In the standard DCC-EX configuration of a EX-CSB1, A is configured for DCC MAIN operation, and B is configured for PROG or programming track output. We recommend connecting your track to the A MAIN output initially to test your Command Station. To alter this default configuration of DCC outputs, or for DC Mode, you would need to configure outputs with a TrackManager command in the mySetup.h file or via Routes. See :doc:`the TrackManager page </trackmanager/index>`

.. TODO XXX [screw terminal image] XXX

The pluggable male screw terminals accept to 16 to 28 AWG/1.5mm^2 gauge solid or stranded wire. If you use stranded, we recommend "tinning" the ends of the wire to make a good connection and ensure that stray wire whiskers don't stray outside the screw terminals and cause a short circuit. Larger wire can handle more current and provide less resistance.  18-22 AWG is a good start. Keep your wires short by mounting the CS close to the track. See the :doc:`/reference/hardware/wire-gauge` page for more information on wire gauge.

Unscrew both screw terminals with a flat blade jeweller's screwdriver. The screws just need to be loosened enough to fit your wires into the holes. Tighten down both screws once you have inserted the wires.

Turning on Power
------------------

Now you can connect your track power supply to the barrel connector on the CSB1 and then plug the other end into the wall. You should see status information on the display including the CSB1 firmware version. 

If you do not have a display or your display is not working, you will need to connect a :doc:`serial monitor </reference/tools/serial-monitor>`.

**Access Point mode VS Station mode**

   * **Access Point (AP) mode** creates a separate WiFi network on the Command Station itself. (Most useful if your layout is away from the house / home network, or you transport your layout frequently.)

   * **Station (STA) mode** allows the Command Station to join as a WiFi device on your home or layout WiFi network. We have the EX-CSB1 set to default to AP mode for convenience of being able to get up and running quickly.

The WiFi LED will illuminate once WiFi is configured and ready as an Access Point (or Station if reconfigured for STA mode.)

DC Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
===============================

The EX-CSB1 is set to operate in DCC mode by default. You can switch to any of the outputs to DC mode.

|HR-DASHED|

DCC vs. DC PWM: A Quick Overview
--------------------------------

**DCC (Digital Command Control):** DCC uses a constant voltage on the track with digital signals embedded in the power to control the speed, direction, and functions of your trains. 

There's no need to worry about polarity in DCC, making wiring simpler as your layout expands. The digital signal allows for precise control of multiple trains on the same track, all receiving power at the same time. Each device connected to the track contains a "decoder" that only responds to commands sent to its unique address.

**DC (Direct Current) PWM:** DC PWM operation suits traditional or legacy locomotive control, where the direction and speed of your trains are controlled by varying the voltage and switching polarity. In DC mode, one rail is positive with respect to the other. The train moves forward when voltage is applied and reverses direction when the polarity is flipped. 

DC control is simpler but less flexible, especially if you want to run multiple trains on the same track simultaneously. Under DCC-EX, DC PWM outputs are given a virtual DCC address which allows WiThrottle/DCC-EX throttles to control your DC locos on the piece of track powered by that output. The DC PWM frequency can be set using virtual DCC Functions 28-31 

.. TODO XXX check! DCC Functions 28-31 

**Managing DCC and DC Modes in TrackManager:** If you are ready to dive into customising your track outputs, |TM| is the tool you'll use. It allows you to easily switch between DCC and DC modes for any track connected to your EX-CSB1. 

You can also set up different tracks for specific purposes, such as making one track a Booster, configuring your PROG track, or enabling Auto-Reverser mode.

For detailed steps on how to use TrackManager to change track modes and settings, check out the :doc:`TrackManager page </trackmanager/index>`.

|HR-DASHED|

DC Operation
-------------

When using DC mode with the EX-CSB1, it is important to understand that this is mode does not produce the traditional varying of the DC voltage to control the speed of your locomotive. The speed of your train is controlled using a method called PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), so instead, the track always receives full voltage whenever the throttle is set above zero.

**How PWM Works** - PWM works by rapidly turning the voltage on and off to the track. The rate at which this happens adjusts the "effective" voltage that the locomotive's motor experiences. For example, if the voltage is on 50% of the time and off 50% of the time, the motor behaves as if it's receiving half of the full voltage. This technique is similar to how a DCC decoder controls a motor in a DCC-equipped locomotive. See the image below from Sparkfun.com for an example:

.. figure:: /_static/images/power/sparkfun_pwm.png
   :alt: PWM waveform image
   :scale: 30%
   :align: center

   PWM Waveform Image. Click the image to enlarge.

**Benefits of PWM in DC Operation** - Using PWM for speed control has several advantages, particularly in terms of smooth operation. Trains start and stop more gradually, and running at slow speeds becomes smoother and more consistent. This gives you better control over your locomotives, making your layout more enjoyable to operate, especially during more delicate manoeuvres.

**Frequency of PWM in DC Operation** - PWM can use a variety of frequencies for the pulses it sends, and this can alter motor behaviour and noise etc. The default frequency used for the CSB1 is xxHz, but this can be varied using the virtual DCC functions 28-31 (check) to allow you to alter the frequency to better suit your loco's motor. This can of course be done during running from the throttle.

.. 
.. Step 5: Start Using or Customising Your Command Station
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. 
.. With the |EX-CSB1| connected, you're ready to start using it or making any necessary adjustments to the configuration. Explore the features and tailor the settings to optimise your model railway experience.
.. 

Changing the Configuration
--------------------------

On subsequent connections of your |EX-CSB1| to you PC loading the drivers will be automatic.

You only need to run the |EX-I| program on your computer following the instructions on the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/installer-rtr` page.

As the |EX-I| program is updated periodically, it is worth checking from time-to-time to see if there is a new version byt checking the :doc:`/ex-installer/index` page.

Uploading EXRAIL Scripts
------------------------

EX‑RAIL is an “EXtended Railroad Automation Instruction Language” that can easily be used to describe sequential command 'sequences' to automatically take place on your model layout. These sequences are defined programmatically in a simple command script file, and uploaded to the Command Station once to configure it. EX-Rail will then run automatically on EX-CommandStation startup, trigger manually, or on occurrence of the specified events.

To find out more about |EX-R| and how to add them to your |EX-CSB1| see the :doc:`/ex-rail/index` page.
