What is EX-CommandStation?
==========================

First some quick definitions. |EX-CS| is two things:

* It is the name of our command station software that runs on different hardware platforms such as the |EX-CSB1|, |BR| and 
* It is the actual hardware with our software installed that runs your model train layout. 

  That means that when you apply power to your Command Station (CS) it will be an |EX-CS| running the latest version of the |EX-CS| software.

An |EX-CS| is a simple, but powerful, DCC and DC Command Station which you can purchase ready-to-run or assemble yourself from widely available parts. It supports much of the NMRA Digital Command Control (DCC) standards, including:

* Simultaneous control of multiple locomotives
* Control of all cab/loco functions (F0-F28 and F29-F68)
* Control of accessory/function decoders (F0-F28 and F29-F68)
* Main Track: Write configuration variable (CV) bytes and set/clear specific CV bits (aka Programming on Main, or POM)
* Programming Track: Same as the main track with the addition of reading CV bytes

   DIY EX-CommandStation

* A |WiThrottle Server| implementation for instant compatibility with popular throttles/controllers 
* General purpose inputs and outputs (I/O) for extensibility
* I2C bus for controlling accessories with I2C capability 
* |JMRI| integration
* |EX-R| Automation and Animation scripting that can control everything on your layout, including the locos

It also supports:

* Direct Current (DC) locomotive control using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

Ready-to-Run (RTR) or Do-It-YourSelf (DIY)
------------------------------------------

To get started, simply choose your path. 

  Whether you are a |Conductor-text|, |Tinkerer-text|, or |Engineer-text|, most people will choose the easy, :doc:`Ready-To-Run</ex-commandstation/ready-to-run/index>` (RTR), option and purchase an |EX-CSB1|. 
  
  Some Tinkerers and Engineers may opt to go the :doc:`Do-It-Yourself</ex-commandstation/diy/index>` (DIY) route by purchasing separate components (or a kit), connecting it together themselves, and installing the |EX-CS| software. 
  
  The choice is yours.
