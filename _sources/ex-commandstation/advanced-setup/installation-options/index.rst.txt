There are three options available to install |EX-CS|:

* |EX-I| is aimed at the |conductor-text| or |tinkerer-text| level user utilising the recommended hardware, and is the simplest option to get |EX-CS| installed and running.
* The |Arduino IDE| is more aimed at the |engineer-text| level user who is using different hardware options or requires a level of customisation not available in |EX-I|.
* **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** (VSC) is more aimed at the |engineer-text| level user who is using different hardware options or requires a level of customisation not available in |EX-I|. It better that the |Arduino IDE| in most respects but takes a bit more effort to setup initially. We don't cover this option on these pages.

.. note::
   
   A word of caution on the approach of using the |Arduino IDE| to install the software:

   While it is possible install the software using the |Arduino IDE|, we *seriously* **DO NOT RECOMMEND IT** for a |conductor-text| or |tinkerer-text|. It is an order of magnitude more complex, much slower, and with a very high probability of getting something wrong unless you really know what you are doing.

   The |EX-I| described below will meet 100% of the needs of a |conductor-text| or |tinkerer-text| with considerably less effort.
