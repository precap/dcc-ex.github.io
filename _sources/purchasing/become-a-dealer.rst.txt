For quantities of 10 or less per year, you may utilize a PCB manufacturing and assembly service such as JLCPCB without licensing fees. A donation to DCC-EX would be appreciated, so click the DONATE button! The production files are available on the `DCC-EX GitHub <https://github.com/DCC-EX/EX-Motorshield8874>`_. 

Entrepreneurs wanting to use the design to offer commercial quantities to their local communities should contact DCC-EX (sales @ dcc-ex.com) to arrange a bulk purchase or a license to manufacture. Licensing includes donating a royalty to DCC-EX per board sold.
