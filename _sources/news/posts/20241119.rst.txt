DCC-EX Releases EX-CSB1 Ready to Run DCC CommandStation
=======================================================

DCC-EX, a global contributor to DCC open source software for model railroading, is proud to announce the second of our open source hardware products: the |EX-CSB1| CommandStation and Booster, providing dual 5 amp DCC and DC PWM (pulse width modulation) output.

The |EX-CSB1| addresses the needs of DCC-EX users who want a ready-to-run DCC CommandStation that will have them running trains within 5 minutes of plugging it into power and track with built-in fast Wifi capability.

A DCC-EX Command Station can now outperform commercial DCC command stations which typically have single 3-3.5A or 5A output capabilities, and doing so at a fraction of the cost and with more advanced features.

The |EX-CSB1| is the  second offering in the DCC-EX open source hardware ecosystem specifically designed for model railroaders, and is a direct result of the strong community engagement DCC-EX strives to inspire.

Featuring an ESP32 processor with built-in fast WiFi, and dual 5A output Texas Instruments DRV8874 MOSFET H-Bridge ICs, the EX-CSB1 features the same proven reliable output stage as the previous EX-MotorShield8874. The DRV8874 H-Bridge ICs also include hardware overcurrent protection monitored by EX-CommandStation, in addition to the existing software-based overload protection. It has a single 2.1mm barrel jack DC power for both the DCC/DC output and to supply the ESP32.

EX-CSB1 also allows stacking of the original EX-MotorShield8874 with zero hardware modifications to provide four DCC and DC PWM track outputs. Now users needing more power or more power districts have a startlingly simple upgrade path.

EX-CSB1's exciting new feature is Booster mode. Using the built-in Railsync compatible DCC input jack and a small piece of EX-RAIL scripting, the EX-CSB1 can switch automatically into Booster mode to produce the same DCC output on any or all of up to 4 DCC outputs. Whilst in Booster mode, the EX-CSB1 can still respond to sensor inputs and perform EX-RAIL animations as a remote animation node.

EX-CSB1 sports I2C support via an industry standard STEMMA QT/Qwiic connectors and pin headers making I2C bus connections easier than ever. The STEMMA QT/Qwiic ecosystem of I2C boards from Adafruit and Sparkfun are now the easiest I2C expansion boards to use. The DCC-EX team expects to add additional STEMMA QT/Qwiic based peripherals with model railroading friendly features in upcoming releases. An I2C SIP header is included to allow many I2C enabled OLED screens to plug directly into the board.
 
The design of the EX-CSB1 was inspired by DCC-EX development team member Harald Barth's comment to Hardware Lead Paul Antoine when he said the ESP32 combined with the EX-MotorShield8874 would make a great compact DCC CommandStation. Working with EX-MotorShield8874 designer Erwin Peterlin of Semify in Austria, the team then designed the prototype EX-CSB1. Paul Antoine's company Millennium Engineering Pty Ltd funded the prototype boards and shipped them to team members around the world for testing. Pre-production testing was complete in May of 2024.

EX-CSB1 is available immediately for purchase in Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia from Millennium Engineering Pty Ltd (orders @ milleng.com.au) for $AU190, plus shipping. It will also be available shortly in the UK through Chesterfield Model Making & Miniature Electronics (https://chesterfield-models.co.uk/product/semify-dcc-ex-motor-shield/), for Â£29.99 plus shipping. Expect further announcements re local availability in the US through DCC-EX directly and Smart Hobby LLC, with other countries to follow.
