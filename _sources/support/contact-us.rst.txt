Recommended Way To Contact Us
=============================

The best way to reach us is on our :ref:`Discord Server <support/index:preferred option: discord>`. 

Usually there is a team member online to help with your issue in English, German and French, and if not you'll get a response within a few hours.

Non-Recommended Ways To Contact Us 
==================================

You can send an email to support@dcc-ex.com.

You can also find *some of us* on Facebook in the `"DCC-EX, DCC++ and Arduino Model Railroading" <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1406785379394934/>`_ private group. 

Many of the project team *do not use Facebook*, so this approach is **not recommended**.

You can also find *some of us* on `TrainBoard <https://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?forums/dcc.177/>`_. 

*Very few of the project team* use TrainBoard, so this approach is **not recommended**.
