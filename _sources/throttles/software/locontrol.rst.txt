This iOS App is simply beautiful, but you would expect this from a team of talented people consisting of an artist/graphic designer, an iOS Developer, and a User Interface (UI) Designer.

Locontrol is compatible with any DCC system with a Wi-Fi module, as MRC (with a Prodigy Wi-Fi Module) or Digitrax (with a LNWI module).

`Get it on the Apple App Store <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/locontrol-dcc-controller/id1473757920>`_
