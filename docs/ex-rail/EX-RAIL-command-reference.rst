Introductory Information
========================

Conventions used on this page
-----------------------------

- CAPITALISED words - These are EX-RAIL commands and are case sensitive
- lowercase words within brackets/braces ``()`` - These are EX-RAIL parameters that must be provided, with multiple parameters separated by a comma ``,``, for example ``SEQUENCE(id)`` or ``DELAYRANDOM(min_delay, max_delay)``
- Quoted ``"text"`` - Text within quote marks ``""`` are used as descriptions, and must include the quote characters, for example ``ROUTE(id, "description")`` becomes ``ROUTE(1, "This is the route description")``
- Square brackets ``[]`` - Parameters within square brackets ``[]`` are optional and may be ommitted. If specifying these parameters, do not include the square brackets themselves, for example ``ALIAS(name[, value])`` becomes ``ALIAS(MY_ALIAS)`` or ``ALIAS(MY_ALIAS, 3)``
- ``|`` - Use of the ``|`` character means you need to provide one of the provided options only, for example ``<D POWER ON|OFF>`` becomes either ``<D POWER ON>`` or ``<D POWER OFF>``

Handy information
-----------------

- COMMANDS are case sensitive. i.e. they must be in uppercase. Text parameters you provide (aliases,  descriptions) are not
- *AUTOMATION*, *ROUTE*, and *SEQUENCE* use the same ID number space, so a ``FOLLOW(n)`` command can be used for any of them
- Sensors and outputs used by AT/AFTER/SET/RESET/LATCH/UNLATCH/SERVO/IF/IFNOT refer directly to Arduino pins, and those handled by |I2C| expansion (as virtual pins or vpins).
- Signals also refer directly to pins, and the signal ID (for RED/AMBER/GREEN) is always the same as the RED signal pin
- It's OK to use sensor IDs that have no physical item in the layout. These can only be LATCHed, tested (IF/IFNOT), or UNLATCHed in the sequences. If a sensor is latched by the sequence, it can only be unlatched by the sequence so ``AT(35) LATCH(35)`` for example, effectively latches sensor 35 on when detected once
- All IDs used in commands and functions will be numbers, or an ALIAS name if configured
- Most IDs simply need to be unique, however RESERVE/FREE and LATCH/UNLATCH must be in the range 0 - 255
- Anywhere a ID or VPIN is required, an Alias or calculation can be used. (e.g. ``ALIAS_NAME + 1``) This can be useful for reference a set of related items.

.. note:: 

  There are four uses of ID numbers in EX-RAIL:

  - AUTOMATION, ROUTE, and SEQUENCE IDs
  - Turnout/Point IDs
  - Vpins - Includes physical pins on the CommandStation, virtual pins (Vpins) on I/O expander modules, and virtual pins that have no physical presence
  - Virtual block IDs as used in RESERVE/FREE

  Therefore, you can have an AUTOMATION, a turnout/point, a Vpin, and a virtual block all defined with the same ID without issue as these will not relate to each other. This is probably a great reason to consider aliases to avoid confusion.

Correct use of DONE, ENDIF, and FOLLOW() statements
---------------------------------------------------

Every |EX-R| automation/route/sequence, event handler, and conditional statement must be terminated by one of these three directives.

On this page, you will see various references to the use of ``DONE``, ``ENDIF``, and ``FOLLOW()`` which can be confusing, so refer to this quick list to help understand the context in which each of these should be used:

- Every conditional statement (all directives starting with the word ``IF``) must be terminated by ``ENDIF``
- Every group of commands within a ROUTE, AUTOMATION, or SEQUENCE must be terminated by either ``DONE`` or ``FOLLOW(id)``
- Every event handler (all directives starting with the word ``ON``) must be terminated by ``DONE``

.. collapse:: For example: (click to show)

  .. code-block:: cpp

    // Valid use of a ROUTE with a nested IF statement
    ROUTE(1)
      IF(46)
        // Things to be done when sensor ID 46 is active
      ELSE
        // Things to be done when sensor ID 46 is inactive
      ENDIF
      DONE

    // Validate use of a sequence that needs to run continuously
    // DONE is not required in this instance
    SEQUENCE(2)
      IF(46)
        // Things to be done when sensor ID 46 is active
      ELSE
        // Things to be done when sensor ID 46 is inactive
      ENDIF
      FOLLOW(2)

    // Validate use of a turnout event handler for turnout ID 200
    ONCLOSE(200)
      // Things to be done when turnout 200 is closed
      DONE

|force-break|

AT(vpin) or AFTER(vpin [,debounceTime]) versus IF(vpin)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When defining conditions, the behaviour of ``AT()`` and ``AFTER()`` is quite different to using conditional ``IF()`` statements.

This applies to all directives starting with ``AT``, ``AFTER``, and ``IF``.

When using ``AT()`` or ``AFTER()``, this is a blocking activity, meaning the sequence of activities will not progress beyond this particular directive unless the condition is met.

When using ``IF`` conditional statements, these will not block if the condition is not met, allowing the sequence of activities to continue.

.. collapse:: For example: (click to show)

  .. code-block:: cpp

    // Use of AT() to prevent doing anything until a sensor is activated
    // This sequence will continue to run until the sensor is activated, in which case those activities will be performed, and it will end
    SEQUENCE(1)
      AT(46)
        // Things to do when sensor 46 is activated
      DONE

    // Use of IF() to continuously monitor a number of sensors
    // This sequence will continually loop to monitor the sensors, meaning the activities related to each sensor are not blocked by the state of other sensors
    SEQUENCE(2)
      IF(46)
        // Things to do if sensor 46 is activated
      ENDIF
      IF(47)
        // Things to do if sensor 47 is activated
      ENDIF
      IF(48)
        // Things to do if sensor 48 is activated
      ENDIF
      FOLLOW(2)

Interactive diagnostics and control
-----------------------------------

.. contents:: In This Section
    :depth: 4
    :local:
    :class: in-this-section

Various diagnostic and control commands have been added to control and interact with |EX-R|, including the various sequences and objects once they have been defined in myAutomation.h and uploaded to the |EX-CS|.

These commands can be run interactively via the serial console or over Ethernet/WiFi if using a throttle or client that provides a suitable interface for sending native DCC-EX commands.

|hr-dashed|

``<D EXRAIL state>`` - Enable or disable EX-RAIL sequence logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the CommandStation is connected to a serial monitor, EX-RAIL sequence logging can be turned on or off (Enabled or Disabled).

----

Aliases
-------

``ALIAS( name[, value] )`` - Assigns name to a value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aliases assigns names to values. They can go anywhere in the sequence. If a value is not assigned, a unique ID will be assigned based on the alias "name" text.

This is a simple substitution that lets you have readable names for things in your sequence. For example, instead of having to remember the VPin a turnout/point is connected to, give the pin number an alias and refer to it by that name. You can use this to name routes, values, pin numbers, or anything you need.

If you simply need a unique identifier for an object used internally to the sequence, such as a turnout/point, route, automation, or sequence, you don't even need to provide an ID, EX-RAIL will generate one automatically when you omit the value parameter. We recommend using this for all your routes, sequences, and other internal objects so you don't have to try to remember or keep a list of numbers you've used. This also prevents you from assigning the same number to more than one object.

REMEMBER: IDs for RESERVE/FREE, LATCH/UNLATCH, and pins must be explicitly defined.

To put this another way, if you connect an LED to pin 23 and want to turn it on and off, you have to explicitly set its pin number, so `ALIAS(TOWER_LED, 23)` lets you equate "23" to TOWER_LED. But if you created a route to run your train around an oval, you don't really need to set the number or even know it. Just use `ALIAS(OVAL)` and let EX assign a number internally. If you ever wanted to know what number it assigns, you can enter `<? OVAL>` from the serial monitor with the Command Station running and it will tell you next to "Opcode=". Since this "hash", as it is called, is generated by the alias name word, it is always unique and always the same for that word even if you have not created the alias yet. Fun fact, "OVAL" will always equal 27500.

Alias naming rules:

- **Must not** be an existing EX-RAIL command name or other reserved word.
- **Should be** reasonably short but descriptive.
- **Must start** with letters A-Z, a-z, or underscore _ (case sensitive!).
- **May then** also contain numbers.
- **Must not** contain spaces or special characters.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **name** - name for the Alias.  See rules above |BR|
|_| > **value** - value to insert in place of the Alias

  .. collapse:: For example: (click to show)

    Defining a pin turnout/point without an alias:

    .. code-block:: cpp

      PIN_TURNOUT(1, 25, "Coal Yard")

    Defining a pin turnout/point with aliases:

    .. code-block:: cpp
      
      ALIAS(COAL_YARD)
      ALIAS(COAL_YARD_PIN, 25)
      PIN_TURNOUT(COAL_YARD, COAL_YARD_PIN, "Coal Yard")

    Note that you could have used the command `ALIAS(COAL_YARD, 1)` in the example above to explicitly set the number, but unless you have a reason to use specific numbers, let the Command Station do it for you. 

    In this simple example, aliases seem like overkill, however consider the case where you need to have the "Coal Yard" turnout/point closed or thrown in various different automation sequences, and you will soon see why it's easier to understand you're throwing the COAL_YARD turnout/point rather than turnout/point ID 12345.

Flow Control
============

Scripts/Sequences - Types and Control
-------------------------------------

.. contents:: In This Section
  :depth: 4
  :local:
  :class: in-this-section

|hr-dashed|

``AUTOSTART`` - Automatically start sequence at this point during Command Station startup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A sequence is automatically started at this point during startup.

If you have previously relied on the implied AUTOSTART to run things immediately,  as of Version 5.0 you must now add this explicitly to the beginning of myAutomation.h

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > none

|hr-dashed|

There are three options to define |EX-R| scripts or sequences:

* AUTOMATION
* ROUTE
* SEQUENCE

|hr-dashed|

``AUTOMATION( id, "description" )`` - Define an automation, advertised to throttles/clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define an automation sequence that is advertised to throttles/clients to send a train along. 

See :ref:`ex-rail/examples:Stopping at a Station (simple loop)` for a simple example.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **id** - id for the sequence/route/automation |BR|
|_| > **description** - description for the sequence/route/automation

|hr-dashed|

``ROUTE( id, "description" )`` - Define a route, advertised to throttles/clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define a route that is advertised to throttles/clients. This can be used to initiate automation sequences such as setting turnouts/points and signals to allow a train to be driven through a specific route on the layout. See :ref:`ex-rail/examples:creating routes` for various examples.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **id** - id for the sequence/route/automation |BR|
|_| > **description** - description for the sequence/route/automation

|hr-dashed|

``SEQUENCE( id )`` - A general purpose sequence, not advertised to throttles/clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A general purpose automation sequence that is not advertised to throttles/clients. This may be triggered automatically on startup, or be called by other sequences or activities. See :ref:`ex-rail/examples:automating various non-track items`, :ref:`ex-rail/examples:Point to Point Shuttle`, and :ref:`ex-rail/examples:multiple inter-connected trains` for further examples.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **id** - id for the sequence/route/automation |BR|
|_| > **description** - description for the sequence/route/automation

|hr-dashed|

All of these sequence types must be terminated by either a ``DONE``, ``FOLLOW(id)``, or ``RETURN`` statement. If you use ``FOLLOW(id)`` or ``RETURN``, you do not also need a ``DONE`` statement as any of these terms will tell |EX-R| that the sequence of events has ended.

|hr-dashed|

``DONE`` - Completes a Sequence/Route/Animation/Event, or any other automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Completes a Sequence/Route/Animation/Event handler, and any other automation definition as shown in the various examples on this page and elsewhere in the |EX-R| documentation.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > none

|hr-dashed|

``ENDTASK`` - Completes a Sequence/Route/Animation/Event, or any other automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Identical to ``DONE``.

Completes a Sequence/Route/Animation/Event handler, and any other automation definition as shown in the various examples on this page and elsewhere in the |EX-R| documentation.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > none

|hr-dashed|

``CALL( id )`` - Branch to a separate sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Branch to a separate sequence, which will need to RETURN when complete.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **id** - id for the sequence/route/automation to branch to

|hr-dashed|

``RETURN`` - Return to the calling sequence when completed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Return to the calling sequence when completed (no DONE required).

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > none

.. collapse:: For example: (click to show)

  For example, you have an AUTOMATION which you initiate that sends a train through your layout with multiple station stops, and you want to do the same things at each station.

  You could write a very long AUTOMATION sequence to do this, or you could write the sound SEQUENCE once, then call it at each station:

  .. code-block:: cpp

    AUTOMATION(21, "Station loop")    // Our station loop sequence
      FWD(30)
      AT(101)                         // At station 1 entrance sensor, call our sequence
      CALL(22)
      AT(102)                         // At station 2 entrance sensor, call our sequence
      CALL(22)
      AT(103)                         // At station 3 entrance sensor, call our sequence
      CALL(22)
      AT(104)                         // At station 4 entrance sensor, call our sequence
      CALL(22)
      FOLLOW(21)                      // Keep looping through the stations (see FOLLOW command reference below)

    SEQUENCE(22, "Station sequence")  // Our station sequence
      FON(2)                         // Blow the horn
      FON(3)                         // Break squeal
      STOP                            // Stop at the station
      FON(4)                         // Let out a hiss from the air breaks for a second
      DELAY(1000)
      FOFF(4)
      DELAYRANDOM(2000, 10000)        // Wait between 2 and 10 seconds for passengers
      FON(2)                         // Blow the horn again
      FWD(30)                         // On our way to the next station
      RETURN                          // Return to the calling sequence

|force-break|

|hr-dashed|

``FOLLOW( sequence_id )`` - Branch or Follow a specified sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Branch or Follow a specified sequence. This lets us do clever things like performing a different sequence depending on whether a turnout/point is CLOSED or THROWN, as well as simple things such as the example above where we keep looping through the same sequence.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **sequence_id** - id for the sequence/route/automation to branch to

  .. code-block:: cpp

    AUTOMATION(23, "Choose your own adventure") // This let's someone control the sequence by throwing a turnout/point (or not)

      IFTHROWN(106)
        FOLLOW(24)

Conditional Statements
----------------------

.. contents:: In This Section
    :depth: 4
    :local:
    :class: in-this-section

There are numerous conditional statements available to influence activities based on the states of sensors, signals, turnouts/points, and other items.

Any directive on this page starting with ``IF`` must have an associated ``ENDIF`` statement, and optionally an ``ELSE`` statement if an alternative activity is to be performed.

If a conditional statement is part of an automation sequence, the sequence still needs to be terminated with a ``DONE``, ``FOLLOW()``, or ``RETURN`` statement.

This include ``IFNOT()``, ``IFRED()``, ``IFAMBER()``, ``IFGREEN()``, 

Refer also to :ref:`ex-rail/ex-rail-command-reference:correct use of done, endif, and follow() statements`.

Signal Objects - Definition and Control
---------------------------------------

.. contents:: In This Section
    :depth: 4
    :local:
    :class: in-this-section

|hr-dashed|

``SIGNAL( red_pin, amber_pin, green_pin )`` - Define a pin based signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define a pin based signal, which requires three active low pins to be defined to correspond with red, amber, and green lights. Active low means they are activated when the associated pins are set to 0V or ground.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **red_pin** - vpin of the red LED. Also defines the signal_id. |BR|
|_| > **amber_pin** - vpin of the amber LED |BR|
|_| > **green_pin** - vpin of the green LED |BR|

|hr-dashed|

``SIGNALH( red_pin, amber_pin, green_pin )`` - Define a pin based signal with active high pins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As above to define a pin based signal, but with active high pins instead. Active high means they are activated when the associated pins are set to 5V (or 3.3V if using a 3.3V device).

For both the SIGNAL/SIGNALH commands, signal colour is set using the pin defined for the red pin. If the signal only has two colours (e.g. RED/GREEN), set the unused colour's pin to 0.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **red_pin** - vpin of the red LED. Also defines the signal_id. |BR|
|_| > **amber_pin** - vpin of the amber LED |BR|
|_| > **green_pin** - vpin of the green LED |BR|

|hr-dashed|

``SERVO_SIGNAL( vpin, red_pos, amber_pos, green_pos )`` - Define a servo based signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define a servo based signal, such as semaphore signals. Each position is an angle to turn the servo to, similar to the SERVO/SERVO2 commands, and SERVO_TURNOUT

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **vpin** - vpin of the servo |BR|
|_| > **red_pos** - position to move the servo to for a red signal |BR|
|_| > **amber_pos** - position to move the servo to for a amber signal |BR|
|_| > **green_pos** - position to move the servo to for a green signal |BR|

|hr-dashed|

``DCC_SIGNAL( id, addr, sub_addr )`` - Define a DCC accessory signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define a DCC accessory signal. Control the colour or aspect of these via the defined ``id``

``DCCX_SIGNAL( Address, redAspect, amberAspect, greenAspect )`` - Defines a signal (with id as dcc address)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|NEW-IN-V5-4-LOGO-SMALL| 

This defines a signal (with id same as dcc address) that can be operated
by the RED/AMBER/GREEN commands.   In each case the command uses the signal address to refer to the signal and the aspect chosen depends on the use of the RED AMBER or GREEN command sent. Other aspects may be sent but will require the direct use of the ASPECT command.

The IFRED/IFAMBER/IFGREEN  and ONRED/ONAMBER/ONGREEN commands continue to operate as for any other signal type. It is important to be aware that use of the ASPECT (see below) or <A> commands will correctly set the IF flags and call the ON handlers if ASPECT is used to set one of the three aspects defined in the DCCX_SIGNAL command. 

Direct use of other aspects does not affect the signal flags. ASPECT and <A> can be used without defining any signal if the flag management or ON event handlers are not required.

All the below turntable/traverser definitions will define turntables/traversers that are advertised to throttles that understand them, unless the HIDDEN keyword is used.

To fully define a turntable/traverser object, you need to define the object first, and then one or more positions.

"description" is an optional parameter, and must be enclosed in quotes "". If you don't wish this turntable/traverser to be advertised to throttles, then substitute the word HIDDEN (with no "") instead of the description.

|hr-dashed|

``DCC_TURNTABLE( id, home_angle, [, "description"] )`` - Define a DCC accessory turntable/traverser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define a DCC accessory turntable/traverser at the specified **id** and the **home_angle** angle.

*Parameters:* |BR|

Define an EX-Turntable turntable/traverser at the specified **id** and **vpin** with a **home_angle** angle.

This statement will create the |EX-TT| turntable/traverser object only, so you will need a separate ``HAL()`` statement for an |EX-TT| device to create the HAL device. It is not recommended to create it via "myHal.cpp".

The HAL creation will require the **vpin** and **i2c_address** parameters.

Controlling Overload/Shorts
---------------------------

.. contents:: In This Section
  :depth: 4
  :local:
  :class: in-this-section

|hr-dashed|

``ONOVERLOAD( track )`` - Event handler for when an Overload occurs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Creates an event handler for the selected track, to be executed when the MotorDriver routines detect and overload. Refer also to :doc:`/trackmanager/index`

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **track** - - The track to configure, valid options are A to H

|hr-dashed|

``AFTEROVERLOAD( track )`` - Event handler for when an Overload clears
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a complementary event handler for the selected track, to be executed when the MotorDriver routines indicate the overload is cleared. Refer also to :doc:`/trackmanager/index`

Note:  AFTEROVERLOAD is only relevant when used within and ONOVERLOAD.... DONE structure.

*Parameters:* |BR|
|_| > **track** - - The track to configure, valid options are A to H

|hr-dashed|

The power calculation routines within |DCC-EX| will check for shorts and overloads and will change the state of the power produced by the MotorDriver board to protect both it and locos from damage.  This is usually eveident by the LED's on the MotorDriver board flashing.  However some users may wish to see some physical notifcation of these events.  This can now be achieved with EXRAIL and the ONOVERLOAD event.


.. collapse:: For example: (click to show)

  This first example shows a warning message to an attached screen with an LED being illuminated to warn the user of the overload.  Once the overload is cleared the AFTEROVERLOAD code is run automatically.
  
  .. code-block:: cpp

    ONOVERLOAD(A)       // the EXRAIL statement to control the event.
      SCREEN(2,0, "OVERLOAD ON TRACK A")     // A message to the second screen
      PRINT("Overload Detected on Track A")   // Message to system moniter
      SET(27)                                 // Turn on an LED perhaps
      AFTEROVERLOAD(A)
          SCREEN(2,0, "RESTORE A POWER ON")
          PRINT("Overload Cleared on A - Power Restored")
          RESET(27)                           // Turn off the LED
          DELAY(2000)
          SCREEN(2,0, "                  ")   // Clear the screen message
    DONE

  If the user wishes to turn off power whilst he/she investigates the problem, then this can be achieved using the second example below.  POWEROFF can be used, but this will turn off powere to all tracks.  Power to the track with the problem can be turned off with a TrackManager command.  However in order to execute the AFTEROVERLOAD routine it is necessary to have a reset routine.

  .. code-block:: cpp

    // This is the event triggered by an overload.  AFTEROVERLOAD cannot be triggered whilst power is OFF.
    ONOVERLOAD(A)
      SCREEN(2,0, "OVERLOAD A POWEROFF")
      PRINT("Overload Detected on A - Turn Off Power")
      SET_TRACK(A, NONE)   // Unsets the TrackManager assignment and turns off power.
      SET(27)              // Light the LED
      AFTEROVERLOAD(A)
          SCREEN(2,0, "RESTORE A POWER ON")
          PRINT("Overload Cleared on A - Power Restored")
          RESET(27)
          DELAY(2000)
          SCREEN(2,0, "                  ")
    DONE

    // The following turns the poweron and allows the AFTEROVERLOAD to run
    // This could also be achieved with a physical button and AFTER(pin) in place of ROUTE()
    ROUTE(12,"Reset A")
      SCREEN(2,0,"                  ")
      SET_TRACK(A, MAIN)
      POWERON
    DONE
