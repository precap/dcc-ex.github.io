.. [1] Requires an additional :ref:`Ethernet <reference/hardware/ethernet-boards:ethernet boards>` or :ref:`WiFi <reference/hardware/wifi-boards:wifi boards>` shield
.. [2] Requires a supported motor driver that supports :ref:`TrackManager <trackmanager/index:hardware requirements and technical notes>`
.. [3] Limited EXRAIL scripts are possible only when disabling EEPROM and programming
.. [4] Features and support in Beta testing can and will change regularly, be sure to keep up to date with developments on our `Discord server <https://discord.gg/y2sB4Fp>`_ 
.. [5] HAL/|I2Cxa| connectivity is only available via the blocking Arduino Wire library at present
.. [6] While the Mega+WiFi boards seem like a good option and are based on our well-known, stable Mega2560 platform, there are many reports of quality issues with these, so buyer beware, and use of these is not recommended
.. [7] The core development team no longer have access to these, and testing is limited to ensuring the software compiles for the board type
.. [8] The core Arduino library has a bug affecting serial console output which can be patched but renders the device unsuited for future development until fixed in the main Arduino core library for SAMD21
.. [9] Direct WiFi connections.  If connected via JMRI, more are are supported
